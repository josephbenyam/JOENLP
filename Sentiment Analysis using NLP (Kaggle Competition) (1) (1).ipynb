    "#### Problem: \n",
    "Terrorist organizations continue to use social media as a prominent tool for recruitment. ISIS Fanboys use common social media platforms like Twitter to carry out radicalization campaigns in hopes of inspiring terror. However, counter-terrorism analysts can apply emerging Natural Language Processing (NLP) Teqniques to gain deeper insights from ISIS Fanboy-generated social media intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Question: \n",
    "Using Natural Language Processing, statistics, or machine learning methods to extract, identify, or otherwise characterize the sentiment content of the following prominent islamic clergy:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Like the Most (Positive Sentiment):\n",
    "     \"Anwar Awlaki\", \n",
    "     \"Ahmad Jibril\", \n",
    "     \"Ibn Taymiyyah\", \n",
    "     \"Abdul Wahhab\"\n",
    " \n",
    "###### Hate the Most (Negative Sentiment):\n",
    "     \"Hamza Yusuf\", \n",
    "     \"Suhaib Webb\", \n",

    "     \"Nouman Ali Khan\", \n",
    "     \"Yaqoubi\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis: \n",
    "I plan to determine which clergy do pro-ISIS fanboys like the most and which ones do they hate the most. Using Natural Language Processing methods to extract, identify, or otherwise characterize the sentiment of the named islamic religious leaders. I will provide brief descriptions of each Islamic clergy for context in understanding the sentiments. This domaine knowledge is critical for effective implementation of sentiment analysis, particularly to bettercomprehend the context.\n",

    "#### Research Data: \n",
    "The dataset consists of 17,000 tweets from 100+ pro-ISIS sympathizers from all over the world since November 2016 Paris Attacks. The dataset is structured and includes.the following labels: name, username, description, location, Number of followers at the time the tweet was downloaded, Number of statuses by the user when the tweet was downloaded, date and timestamp of the tweet, the tweet itself. However, we can conduct out sentiment analysis with an aggreagation of the the tweets.\n",

    "##### Brief Description:\n",
    "Notable 14th century islamic religious scholar. Espoused the famous Faqi form of Islamic jurisprudence. Believed that Islamic form of government can vary from time to time and place to place depending on custom and circumstances, as long as Shariah is safeguarded.\n",
    "His main issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifted the focus of jihad from personal and social to military (politization of jihad) *this was not a theme of reform Necessity of maintaining the flexibility of Islamic law through ijtihad  *a theme of reformà to make sure that its government is still Islamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting the ethos of fatalism: The opposite of ijtihad is following precedent.  The idea that when you are living in a society that says that everything is fine and you should just accept it because it is God’s will traces back to the time when.\n",
    " \n",
    "His main doctrine was, in Ḥanbalī fashion, based on the supremacy of Qurʿān and sunnah (received custom) and the salaf (early Muslims)as ultimate authorities.  He thought that the form of government can vary but legal authority does not only remain distinct from executive administration but is also of primary importance: an Islamic legal system must be maintained to give the government legitimacy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Believed that many of the problems of the Muslim world in his time resulted from leaders’ efforts to keep that world politically unified.  Ideally, the community was united, but in reality, it was divided into regional units.  \n",
    "\n",
    "He was distrustful of non-Mislims but insisted on religious freedom.  Rejection of fatalism and rejection of intercession of the saints.  Argued that ijtihad must remain active and was a religious duty, lest Islamic law become irrelevant.  He stressed the difference between Shariah and fiqh."
